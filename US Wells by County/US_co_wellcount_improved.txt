File Name:  US_co_wellcount_improved.shp

Data Source:  Various state regulatory agencies, US Census Bureau

Data Link:  Various (see below)

Date Range:  1/2000 through 2/2014

Notes:  This file contains the number of active oil and gas wells per county in the United States, as of February 2014.  For the purpose of this layer, "active" mean wells that have been spudded (drilled), but have not yet been permanently plugged.  This includes wells that are not yet in production and wells that are no longer in production.  

Well data were obtained from the various state-level oil and gas regulatory agencies, with the exception of Maryland and North Carolina, which were unable to provide any data about the location of their wells upon request.  While individual well data in Texas could not be obtained for this project, well counts by county were available.
